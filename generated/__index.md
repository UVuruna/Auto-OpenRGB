Auto-generated VBS scripts for time-based RGB profile switching.

## Purpose

Contains VBS scripts generated by [setup.ps1](../setup.md). These files use system time to determine which RGB profile to activate.

## Contents

| File | Description | Used For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| autoprofile.vbs | Daily profiles with retry logic | Task Scheduler (at logon) |
| autorainbow.vbs | Rainbow profiles from `rainbow` | Keyboard shortcut |

## How It Works

1. Get current hour using `Hour(Now)`
2. Match hour to profile range using `Select Case`
3. Launch OpenRGB with the appropriate profile (hidden)

### autoprofile.vbs (Task Scheduler)

Has additional retry logic:
- Waits for OpenRGB server to be ready (max 60 sec)
- Checks every 2 seconds if `OpenRGB.exe` process exists
- Ensures profile is applied even if script runs before server starts

### autorainbow.vbs (Manual)

No retry logic - assumes OpenRGB server is already running.

## Time Calculation

Times are automatically calculated from `config.json`:
- `duration = 24 / number_of_profiles`
- `start = startHour + (duration * index)`
- `end = start + duration`

## Usage

### autoprofile.vbs
Runs automatically at logon and resume from sleep via Task Scheduler.

### autorainbow.vbs
Can be run via:
- Double-click
- Keyboard shortcut (Razer Synapse Hypershift, AutoHotkey, etc.)

## Notes

- Files are NOT edited manually - edit `config.json` then run `setup.ps1`
- All VBS files run hidden (no window)
