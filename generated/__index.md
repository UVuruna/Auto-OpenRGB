Auto-generated BAT files for time-based RGB profile switching.

## Purpose

Contains BAT files generated by [setup.ps1](../setup.md). These files use system time to determine which RGB profile to activate.

## Contents

| File | Description | Used For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| autoprofile.bat | Daily profiles from `schedules` | Task Scheduler (at logon) |
| autorainbow.bat | Rainbow profiles from `rainbow` | Keyboard shortcut |

## How It Works

BAT files:
1. Read current hour from system time
2. Compare with calculated ranges for each profile
3. Launch the appropriate OpenRGB profile

Times are automatically calculated from `config.json`:
- `duration = 24 / number_of_profiles`
- `start = startHour + (duration * index)`
- `end = start + duration`

## Usage

### autoprofile.bat
Runs automatically at logon via Task Scheduler.

### autorainbow.bat
Can be run via:
- Double-click
- Keyboard shortcut (e.g., via AutoHotkey or Windows shortcut)

## Notes

- Files are NOT edited manually - edit `config.json` then run `setup.ps1`
- If OpenRGB server is running → instant change
- If server is not running → 2-3 sec delay (OpenRGB starts up)
